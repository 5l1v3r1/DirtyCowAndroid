Grab SU, Rageagainstthecage-arm5.bin and busybox

3)Place all three files in a convenient location for pushing with adb (your /[Path-To-SDK]/platform-tools directory would be a great idea)

4)We need to get our rooting tools onto the phone, so from your terminal, type:

Code (Text):
adb push su /data/local/temp
adb push rageagainstthecage-arm5.bin /data/local/temp/rage
adb push busybox /data/local/temp
Now enter adb shell like this:

Code (Text):
adb shell
You will now see a "$" prompt.

Type:

Code (Text):
./data/local/temp/rage
Now wait until you get kicked all the way back to your terminal prompt. If you see the "$", don't do anything, just keep waiting! When it's done you'll be all the way out of ADB, which you will now need to restart.

5) Get back to the adb shell:

Code (Text):
adb shell
Instead of a "$" prompt, you should now see a "#". Congratulations! You're rooted!

Now to make it stick:

6) (This is the part that people were getting stuck on) Now you need to remount your /system directory as read/write, so type:

Code (Text):
mount -o remount,rw -t ext3 /dev/mmcblk0p12 /system
Your /system directory is now mounted read/write.

Now to move the tools we pushed earlier into their new homes:


Code (Text):
cd /system/bin
cat /data/local/temp/su > su
cat /data/local/temp/busybox > busybox
chmod 4755 su
chmod 4755 busybox
At this point, you may want to remove the files you put in /data/local/temp: This is just housekeeping, the files won't hurt anything if you leave them there.

(optional)
Code (Text):
rm /data/local/temp/su
rm /data/local/temp/busybox
rm /data/local/temp/rage
Then reboot:

Code (Text):
reboot
